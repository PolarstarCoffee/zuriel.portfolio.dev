-Bio-
Hi! I'm Octavio Zuriel Zavala, an undergraduate student at Depaul University pursuing a BS in Game Design, 
alongside a minor in Computer Science. I aim to develop robust, layered systems to further immerse players in memorable
experiences akin to my own as a child. In tangent, I intend to expand my skillset outwards into adjacent fields
within technology to forever continue to grow.
