                I’m Octavio Zuriel Zavala, and I’m a ludicrously huge enthusiast in the realms of game development and
                tech. During my
                time at DePaul University, I had studied game design for my bachelor’s with my minor in computer
                science. Amidst my
                studies I grew to love the process of executing an idea or concept through programming. I will never
                forget the late
                nights of debugging and scouring through documentation to eventually lead to the eureka moment in which
                everything falls
                into its correct place. Combining that with developing alongside an even more passionate team only
                solidified my love
                for the field, the people, and their craft.

                Now that I’ve graduated, I look forward to the next opportunity in which I can contribute my passion and
                technical
                skills to bring to life more wonderful and strange digital experiences. While always trying my best to
                remain frontwards facing
